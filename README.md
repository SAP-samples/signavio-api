# SAP Signavio API

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/signavio-api)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/signavio-api)

## Description

This repository provides Postman collections and environments as well as other guidance to jumpstart your development with SAP Signavio solutions.

### Postman Collections

Postman is an application which enables developers to design, build and test APIs. A Postman collection is a group of saved API requests for use in the application.

For your convenience, this repository provides Postman collections which you can reuse to access SAP Signavio APIs.

### Postman Environments

Postman allows the use of variables so you can store and reuse values in different places. A Postman environment is a set of related variables grouped together to make using collections more convenient.

## Requirements

You should have already downloaded and installed Postman. If not, it is available via the [Postman Downloads page](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

For further requirements specific to a collection, refer to the instructions in the relevant subfolder.


## Download and Installation

To begin using a Postman collection, follow these steps.

1. Download a collection JSON file from this repository and save it to your local file system.
2. If there is an associated environment file, download and save this file also. For example, the file `SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.postman_collection.json` has an accompanying file, `SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.postman_environment.json`.
3. In Postman, select **File** &rarr; **Import** and then **Upload Files**.<br>This opens a file selection dialogue.
4. Select the collection and/or environment files you downloaded, then **Open**.<br>This displays a summary of the files to be imported.
5. Select **Import**.<br>This adds the collection and any environment to your workspace.
